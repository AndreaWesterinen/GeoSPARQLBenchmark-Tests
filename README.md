# GeoSPARQL Benchmark

This project contains the GeoSPARQL Benchmark, integrated into the HOBBIT Platform.

The GeoSPARQL Benchmark (GSB) aims to evaluate GeoSPARQL compliance of RDF storage systems. The current version of the benchmark is based on the [GeoSPARQL subtest](https://github.com/BorderCloud/TFT-tests/tree/master/geosparql) of [Tester-for-Triplestores](https://github.com/BorderCloud/TFT) and the [SPARQLScore](http://sparqlscore.com/) standard conformance test suite.
