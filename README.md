# GeoSPARQL Benchmark

This is the GeoSPARQL Benchmark, integrated into the [HOBBIT Platform](https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform).

The GeoSPARQL Benchmark (GSB) aims to evaluate GeoSPARQL compliance of RDF storage systems. This version of the benchmark, `develop/2`, is based on the requirements defined in the official [OGC GeoSPARQL standard](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql).
