# GeoSPARQL Benchmark

This is the GeoSPARQL Benchmark, integrated into the [HOBBIT Platform](https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform).

The GeoSPARQL Benchmark (GSB) aims to evaluate GeoSPARQL compliance of RDF storage systems. This branch of the benchmark, `tft`, is based on the [GeoSPARQL subtest](https://github.com/BorderCloud/TFT-tests/tree/master/geosparql) of [Tester-for-Triplestores (TFT)](https://github.com/BorderCloud/TFT) and the [SPARQLScore](http://sparqlscore.com/) standard conformance test suite.
